## NCBI ASHG Workshop 2021

### Enhanced Search Capabilities and Ease of Use of NCBI SRA Data on the Cloud 

This workshop will introduce you to powerful metadata searches for the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) by using interactive metadata queries in the cloud. This service expands the search tools available for SRA and saves time by finding exactly the data you want more quickly than ever before. We will discuss metadata searches in AWS and GCP using common database query methods and demonstrate how to use the metadata tables for searching. We'll run through a hands-on exercises: 1.) finding sequence data based on k-mer searches for specific taxonomic IDs and 2.) filtering runs to find exactly what you want. We will also provide demonstrations and examples to help you better understand how to build your own searches and find the data you want. We will be using Structured Query Language (SQL) to do these searches but no prior SQL experience is required. By the end of this seminar you will know how to run cloud metadata queries to find SRA data based on parameters that interest you.

Please be advised that in many cases the permissions have been set to allow Notebooks to run on our servers. Some additional programs may need to be loaded to help the notebooks run if they are transferred elsewhere.  Also, permissions to make queries to BigQuery and AWS require credentials that can be set up by your institution.
